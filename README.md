# Rocket Science Client
The presumption is that you are a professional Web developer familliar with Git and (a framework like) Vue.js, evaluating the project as a portfolio piece. 
 
In this document I'll describe how to set up the project locally and how it is deployed to it's [production environment on Heroku](https://mercury-atlas.herokuapp.com/).


[Clone the RocketScience project](git@github.com:Satyadarshin/RocketScience.git).  
 cd into the resulting project and clone this repo into a directory named `/client`.  
`cd client`  
 then install the dependencies
`npm install`

## Express server
`cd ../`

## Local dev
Runs under port 8080.  
`npm run serve`

## Unit tests
`npm run test:unit`
